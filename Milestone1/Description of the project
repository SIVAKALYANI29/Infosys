# 🧠 Milestone 1 Final Task: Mini Knowledge Graph Builder

**Covers Topics from Days 1–6**  
*(Project Understanding • Environment Setup • Git & Structure • NER • Relation Extraction • Graph Visualization)*

---

## 🎯 Objective

You will build a Mini Knowledge Graph System that extracts useful information from text and visualizes how concepts are connected.

By completing this task, you will demonstrate your understanding of:
- How to prepare and organize a project environment  
- How to extract meaningful entities and relationships from text  
- How to represent knowledge in a visual graph form

## 📌 Project Title

**Mini Knowledge Graph Builder**

---

## 📂 Dataset Details

**Tech Legends and Their Inventions**  
This project shows how famous people in computer science are connected to the technologies they helped build or describe.

---

## 📝 Short Description of Your Dataset

The dataset includes five entries. Each one links a person to a technology using a simple action like "invented" or "created".  
It helps us understand who did what in tech history.

---

## 🔍 Summary of Entities and Relationships Extracted

We extracted three parts from each entry:
- **Subject**: the person (e.g., Alan Turing)  
- **Relation**: the action (e.g., invented)  
- **Object**: the technology (e.g., Turing Machine)  

This forms a clear connection between people and their work.

## 🖼️ Screenshot of Your Knowledge Graph

You can take a screenshot of the graph showing nodes like **"Alan Turing"** connected to **"Turing Machine"** with the label **"invented"**.  
If you want, I can help you generate this graph using Python and PyVis.

## 💡 Reflection: What Did I Learn from Milestone 1?

- I learned how to build a dataset using triples (subject, relation, object).  
- I understood how to show connections between people and technologies.  
- I also learned how to turn data into a visual graph that’s easy to understand.  
- This helped me see how knowledge graphs work in real life.
